  - Firebase Authentication (free tier)
  - Local Storage for photos (free)
  - AsyncStorage for data persistence (free)
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## 💰 Cost-Free Approach

This app is designed to be completely free to run:
- ✅ **Firebase Auth**: Free for 10,000 authentications/month
- ✅ **No Firebase Storage costs** - Using local AsyncStorage
- ✅ **No database costs** - Using local storage for MVP
- ✅ **No hosting costs** - Running locally

## 📊 Data Storage (Local)

```typescript
// Items stored locally
items: Item[] = [
  {
    id: "item-1",
    name: "Keys",
    location: "Kitchen drawer",
    photoUrl: "local://photo-123",
    createdAt: new Date(),
    userId: "user-1"
  }
]

// Photos stored as base64 in AsyncStorage
photos: {
  "photo_123": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQ..."
}
```
